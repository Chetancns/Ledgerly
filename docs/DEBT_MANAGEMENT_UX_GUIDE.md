## Best Practices

### For Daily Use

1. **Start with "Open"** - Focus on what needs attention

3. **Sort by Due Date** - See what's coming up
4. **Check Overdue Weekly** - Stay on top of late payments

### For Settlement Groups

1. **Name groups clearly** - "weekend-trip", "december-expenses"
2. **Use batch settlement** - Settle whole groups at once
3. **Filter by group** - Review before settling
4. **Select All** - Save time with bulk actions

### For Large Debt Lists

1. **Use Search heavily** - Fastest way to find anything
2. **Filter by Person** - See all debts with one person
3. **Sort by Amount** - Prioritize large debts
4. **Hide Settled** - Keep view clean

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

- Check your search term for typos
- Try searching by person instead of debt name
- Clear search and use filters instead
- Make sure debt exists in current status filter

### "Select All not working"

- Make sure you're in batch mode (green button)
- Must be on "📁 Groups" tab
- Select All only affects visible/filtered debts
- Check if settlement group is selected

### "Can't find a debt"

- Check which status filter is active
- Settled debts hidden in "Open" view
- Try searching by name or person
- Use "All Status" to see everything
